# **Little Free Library**

Dear **Mayor Adams**,

I am writing this letter to call for support and expansion of a New York City based organization known as Little Free Libraries. The disparity of all 150 built can clearly be seen when looking at each borough.

| Borough   	| Libraries Built |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Brooklyn  	| 68          	|
| Queens    	| 47          	|
| Staten Island | 33          	|
| Manhattan 	| 24          	|
| The Bronx 	| 11          	|

For better visualization or to explore external neighborhoods, please refer to this [**interactive map**](https://app.littlefreelibrary.org/ourmap). *Utilize the search bar in the top left*

**The reason** I bring this to your attention are because they offer immense benefits to the local communities that they are built in. Such as...

> -   Offering literary resources to those in need

> -   Material applicable to all ages

> -   Promoting general literacy activities

> -   Encouraging communal sharing and activities

<br>

There are many ways these libraries benefit a community and bring them together, all of which can be explained in more depth in the following video:

With such an uneven outreach of these libraries across the boroughs, it becomes increasingly imperative to expand. An increase could lead to more opportunities for those whom cannot easily access literary material and offer a closer alternative to libraries. Something that is especially true when considering lower income communities.

*Please submit your response to our query here:*

### **Sincerely**,

Ora Kauffman and the Free Little Library Team
