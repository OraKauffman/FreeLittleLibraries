Free Little Libraries in NYC is a community-driven initiative dedicated to promoting literacy, sharing stories, and fostering a love of reading across the city. Our network of small, volunteer-maintained book-sharing boxes allows New Yorkers to take a book, leave a book, and connect with their neighbors through the power of stories.

We believe that access to books should be free and easy for everyone, no matter their background or location. From bustling Manhattan streets to quiet Brooklyn corners, our little libraries serve as beacons of knowledge, creativity, and community spirit.

Whether youâ€™re donating a well-loved novel, picking up a new favorite, or simply admiring the joy of book-sharing, we invite you to be part of our growing network. Join us in making NYC a city where books are always within reach!
